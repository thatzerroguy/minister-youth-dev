He was appointed substantive Minister on the 23 October, 2024. The second quarter performance review of the Ministry by the Central Delivery Coordination Unit (CDCU) shows the progress and impacts of his leadership.  Specifically, 

1. The Ministry sets  a target of training 10,000 youths in digital skills. We passed this goal and reached 14,509 young Nigerians.

2. The Ministry planned to support 80,000 youths in mentorship, internship, apprenticeship, and career development. We went beyond that and reached 97,212 beneficiaries.


3. In crime reduction and peace-building, the Ministry targets 2,500 youths. But we achieved more than that; we trained 5,023 — more than double the target.


4. The Nigerian Youth Academy (NIYA) has recorded over 250,000 youths actively engaged across its key components (NiYA Academy, NiYA Gigs, NiYA Jobs & Internship, and  NiYA Community).


5. The Nigerian Youth HelpDesk, which we launched to give Nigerian youth a platform to connect with the government and receive immediate support, is also doing very well. 


   So far, we have received a total of 5, 745 cases, out of which 3,447 (representing 60%) have been resolved, while 1,551 (representing 27 %) are pending.
